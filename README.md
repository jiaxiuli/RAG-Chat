# ðŸ§  RAG Chat System (FastAPI + React + PostgreSQL + pgvector)

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chat system built with **FastAPI** (backend), **React + Zustand** (frontend), and **PostgreSQL with pgvector** for embedding storage.

It supports:
- Uploading and parsing PDFs  
- Generating embeddings using the OpenAI API  
- Storing and searching document chunks via pgvector  
- Chatting with an LLM using your own documents as knowledge  
- Real-time streaming responses over WebSocket  
- Conversation history, logging, and deletion APIs
